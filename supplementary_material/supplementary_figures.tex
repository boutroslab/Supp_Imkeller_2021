\textbf{Engineered APC truncation in HCT116 and RKO cells}\\
A: Strategy for generation of APC$^{trunc}$ single cell clones from HCT116 and RKO cell lines\\
B: Western blot analysis of APC protein size and expression in HCT116, HCT116-APC$^{trunc}$\#2, RKO and RKO-APC$^{trunc}$\#5 cells. Detection of viculin was used as a loading control.\\
C: TCF4/Wnt-reporter activity in HCT116, HCT116-APC$^{trunc}$\#2, RKO and RKO-APC$^{trunc}$\#5 cells. Results show normalized mean +/- SD reporter activity over seven technical replicates within one experiment. The data is representative of at least three independent experiments that were performed.

\textbf{Analysis of whole-genome CRISPR screen.}\\
A: Between replicate correlation coefficient for the four different cell lines (HCT116 and RKO with APC$^{WT}$ ("WT") and APC$^{trunc}$ ("APC"). Each screen was performed in 2 replicates. \\
B: Between replicate correlation. gRNA counts after the screen in replicates R2 vs. R1 are displayed (pseudocount added and displayed as logarithm of 2). The red line indicates the results of a linear model fitting (using the function ggplot2::geom\_smooth(method = "lm")). \\
C: Precision-recall curves based on "core-essential" and "non-essential" gene assignment as in BAGEL software (Hart et al. 2016). One precision-recall curve was calculated for every individual cell line by comparing gRNA abundance before and after the screen. All four screens showed satisfying precision-recall statistics, indicating a good data quality for phenotype detection.\\
D: Results from gscreend analysis comparing gRNA abundance after the screen in APC$^{trunc}$ versus APC$^{WT}$ cells. Genes are classified as "core-essential" or "non-essential" as in C. The horizontal line indicates an adjusted p-value of 0.1.\\

\textbf{Gene set enrichment analysis on genetic dependencies.}\\
We performed gene set enrichment analysis using Reactome (A-C) and GO cellular component (D-F) gene set annotation. For both annotation schemes, enrichment analysis was performed for RKO background (A+D), HCT116 background (B+E) and DepMap data (C+F). For RKO and HCT116 background the genes were ordered according to their differential essentiality in APC$^{trunc}$ compared to APC$^{WT}$ cells. For the analysis on DepMap data, genes were ordered according to their differential essentiality in Wnt-high compared to Wnt-low cell lines. Negative enrichment scores thus indicate gene sets whose members are more essential in APC$^{trunc}$ or Wnt-high cells than in APC$^{WT}$ or Wnt-low cells. \\

\textbf{Gene set enrichment analysis on differential transcript and protein expression.}\\
We performed gene set enrichment analysis using Reactome (A+B and E+F) and GO cellular component (C+D and G+H) gene set annotation. For both annotation schemes, enrichment analysis was performed for tumor tissue (TCGA, A-D) and colorectal cancer cell lines (DepMap, E-H). The gene list used for GSEA was ordered according to differential transcript expression (A, C, E, G) or differential protein abundance (B, D, F, H) in Wnt-high compared to Wnt-low tumors and cell lines. Positive enrichment scores indicate gene sets whose members are higher expressed in Wnt-high compared to Wnt-low cells and tumors.
